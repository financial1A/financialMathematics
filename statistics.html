<p>
<strong> Population:</strong> A population is the entire group of individuals or items of interest to a study. For example, if you are studying the heights of all adults in a country, the population would be the entire adult population.</p>
<br><br> <p>
<strong> Sample:</strong> A sample is a subset of a population. It is often not feasible to collect data from the entire population, so a sample is selected to represent the population.
</p><br><br> <p>
    <strong> Descriptive statistics:</strong> Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and presenting data using measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphical representations like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Inferential statistics:</strong> Inferential statistics involves making inferences or generalizations about a population based on sample data. It uses techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Probability:</strong> Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It provides a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Hypothesis testing:</strong> Hypothesis testing involves making decisions or drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data. It typically involves formulating a null hypothesis (no effect or no difference) and an alternative hypothesis, and then using statistical tests to evaluate the evidence against the null hypothesis.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Confidence interval:</strong> A confidence interval is a range of values within which the true population parameter is estimated to lie with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval provides a range within which we can be 95% confident that the true population parameter exists.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Regression analysis:</strong> Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is often used for prediction or determining the effect of variables on an outcome.
</p><br><br> <p>
<strong> Correlation:</strong> Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, with 0 indicating no correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation.

        normal distribution:
    </h1>
    <p>
        It is characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
    </p>
<p><ul>
   <li>The mean (μ) represents the central tendency or the average of the distribution.</li> 
<li> The standard deviation (σ) represents the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean.</li> 
</ul>
The shape of a normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the highest point at the mean and gradually tapering off on either side. The curve is symmetric, meaning that the left and right halves are mirror images of each other.
<br><br>
The properties of a normal distribution include:


<ol>
    <li>The Empirical Rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule): In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.</li>
   <br> <li>The mean, median, and mode are equal: In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode all have the same value, which is located at the center of the distribution.</li>
   <br> <li>The distribution is fully defined by its mean and standard deviation: Once you know the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution, you can determine the probabilities associated with different values or ranges of values using statistical tables or software.</li>
   <br> <li>The shape is symmetric: The left and right halves of the distribution mirror each other. This means that the probability of observing a value above the mean is the same as observing a value below the mean at an equal distance.</li>
